<p>GM: remember to divide tasks into smaller parts. Some tasks remain impossible, as you’re animals. You can talk to other animals of the same or similar species.</p>

<p>Take turns to act. You can’t act twice in a row.
Enemies don’t roll dice – they force you to roll dice.</p>
 
<p> If the task is dangerous, you are gain a point of danger if you fail. Using magic is always dangerous. If you roll equal to or under your current danger, you’re out of the game. You can lower your danger by running away or solving the problem.</p>
